	<h4>Hi there!</h4>
	<p>Thanks for checking out my website. Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in sociology at <a href="http://sociology.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a>, where I focus mainly within <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.soc.30.012703.110644" target="_blank">organizational sociology</a>. My dissertation research addresses individual and organizational human capital, scientific innovation, and career paterns. I have additional projects with colleagues looking at the influence of government support on patents, career patterns of successful academics, and computational methods for analyzing culture and politics in news media.</p>
	<p>Methodologically, I am interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational sociology</a> and the application of data science methods to social phenomena, such as social network analysis and automated content analysis of text, as well as recent developments in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2619v1.pdf" target="_blank">causal inference methods</a>.
