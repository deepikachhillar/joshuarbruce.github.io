	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	<p>Thanks for checking out my website! I’m a PhD student in sociology at <a href="http://sociology.duke.edu/">Duke University</a> and a Graduate Scholar with Duke’s <a href="http://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/regulation/">Rethinking Regulation Program</a>. I am currently preparing my dissertation proposal, which draws heavily on administrative personnel data, augmented by other government-derived data, such as rules published in the Federal Register. This research is part of the project on <a href="https://ssri.duke.edu/projects/human-capital-career-dynamics-and-organizational-performance-us-federal-government">Human Capital, Career Dynamics, and Organizational Performance in the U.S. Federal Government</a>, which I am the Project Manager for. I also have ongoing projects with colleagues looking at the influence of government support on patents, career patterns of successful academics, and computational methods for analyzing culture and politics in news media.</p>
