	<h4>Hi there!</h4>
	<p>Thanks for visiting my website. I’m a PhD candidate in sociology at <a href="http://sociology.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a>, with a concentration in economic and organization sociology. Substantively, my research focuses on the consequences of employment dynamics for both workers and organizations, with an emphasis on large non-profits, such as the US government and research universities. I use large administrative data sets to explore how employees’ career patterns influence their work outcomes (pay; promotions), and how combinations of employees’ skills affect organizational performance (patent generation; scientific innovation). I employ both conventional econometrics and newly developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2619v1.pdf" target="_blank">causal inference</a> methods to study these phenomena.</p>
