	<h4>Hi there!</h4>
	<p>Thanks for checking out my website. Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in sociology at <a href="http://sociology.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a>. My research primarily focuses on work, occupations, and careers in knowledge-intensive sectors of the modern economy (e.g., government scientists, university academics, and private-sector R&amp;D personnel). I am especially interested in the returns to human and social capital for individuals and the organizations they interact with in these sectors. Additional to my interests in <a href="https://oowsection.org/" target = "_blank">organizations, occupations, and work</a>, I have ongoing projects that employ computational and causal methods to study political preferences and news media.</p> 

	<p>Methodologically, I am interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational sociology</a> and the application of data science methods to social phenomena, especially social network analysis and automated content analysis of text, as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2619v1.pdf" target="_blank">causal inference methods</a>.
