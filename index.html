	<h4>Hi there!</h4>
	<p>Thanks for visiting my website. Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in sociology at <a href="http://sociology.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a>, with concentrations in economic sociology and organization theory. Substantively, my research focuses on the consequences of employment dynamics for both workers and the organizations they interact with. Looking at individuals, I am especially interested in how different patterns of work experience influence employment outcomes, such as salary and managerial promotion. Turning to organizations, I examine how personnel expertise and capabilities affect technological innovation.</p>
    <p>
    To address these research topics, I mostly rely on large datasets, such as US patent records<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and administrative data on federal government employees.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref1">2</a></sup> I employ both conventional econometrics and newly developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2619v1.pdf" target="_blank">causal inference</a> methods to study these phenomena.</p>
    <p>
    In addition to my normal graduate student responsibilities, I am also a Project Manager at Duke's Social Science Research Institute, where I take care of administrative issues, such as IRB documentation, for the <a href="https://ssri.duke.edu/projects/human-capital-career-dynamics-and-organizational-performance-us-federal-government" target="_blank">Human Capital and Career Dynamics project</a>.
