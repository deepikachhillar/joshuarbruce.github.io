	<h4>Hi there!</h4>
	<p>I'm an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/business-administration" target="_blank">Business Administration</a> at the <a href="https://business.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Gies College of Business</a>, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. At Gies, my teaching will focus on strategic human resources management and research methods and design</p>
	<p>My research focuses on the consequences of employment dynamics for both workers and the organizations they interact with. Looking at individuals, I am especially interested in how different patterns of work experience influence employment outcomes, such as salary and managerial promotion. Turning to organizations, I examine how personnel expertise and capabilities affect organizational performance, such as patenting innovations.</p>
	<p>To address these research topics, I mostly rely on large datasets, including US patent records and administrative data on federal government employees. I employ both conventional econometrics and more recently developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational</a> methods to study these phenomena.</p>
