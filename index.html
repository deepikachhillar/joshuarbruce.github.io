		<p>I am an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/business-administration" target="_blank">Business Administration</a> at the <a href="https://business.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Gies College of Business</a>, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. At Gies, I teach courses on strategic human resources management and research methods and design.</p>
		<p>My research focuses on the consequences of employment dynamics for both workers and the organizations with which they interact. Looking at individuals, I am especially interested in how different patterns of work experience influence employment outcomes, such as salary and managerial promotion.</p>

		<p>Turning to organizations, I examine how personnel expertise and capabilities affect organizational performance, such as patenting innovations. Ongoing work ties these two streams of research together, looking at how individuals' organizational fit interacts with labor market demands, driven by changes in organizations' human capital needs.</p>
		<p>To address these research topics, I mostly rely on large datasets, including US patent records and administrative data on federal government employees. I employ both conventional econometrics and more recently developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational</a> methods to study these phenomena.</p>
