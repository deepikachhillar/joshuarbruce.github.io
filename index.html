	<h4>Hi there!</h4>
	<p>Thanks for visiting my website. Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in sociology at <a href="http://sociology.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a>, with concentrations in economic sociology and organization theory. Substantively, my research focuses on the consequences of employment dynamics for both workers and the organizations they interact with. Looking at individuals, I am especially interested in how different patterns of work experience influence employment outcomes, such as salary and managerial promotion. Turning to organizations, I examine how personnel expertise and capabilities affect technological innovation.</p>

		<p>To address these research topics, I mostly rely on large datasets, such as US patent records and administrative data on federal government employees. I employ both conventional econometrics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational</a> and causal inference methods to study these phenomena.</p>
   
	<p>In addition to conducting research, I taught a core course on <a href="https://markets.duke.edu/courses/355" target="_blank">organizations and management</a> in Duke's Markets and Management certificate program and mentored undergraduate and masters students in a 10-week <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/analytics-faculty-success" target="_blank">data analytics program</a>. I am currently a Project Manager at Duke's Social Science Research Institute for the <a href="https://ssri.duke.edu/projects/human-capital-career-dynamics-and-organizational-performance-us-federal-government" target="_blank">Human Capital and Career Dynamics project</a>.</p>
