	<h4>Hi there!</h4>
		<p>I'm an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://business.illinois.edu/ba/areas/organizational-behavior/" target="_blank">Organizational Behavior</a> in the Department of Business Administration at the <a href="https://business.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Gies College of Business</a>, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </p>
		<p>I recently completed my PhD in sociology at Duke University, with concentrations in economic sociology and organizational theory. My research focuses on the consequences of employment dynamics for both workers and the organizations they interact with. Looking at individuals, I am especially interested in how different patterns of work experience influence employment outcomes, such as salary and managerial promotion. Turning to organizations, I examine how personnel expertise and capabilities affect organizational performance, such as patenting innovations.</p>

		<p>To address these research topics, I mostly rely on large datasets, including US patent records and administrative data on federal government employees. I employ both conventional econometrics and more recently developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational</a> methods to study these phenomena.</p>
		<!-- <p>In addition to conducting research, I taught a core course on <a href="https://markets.duke.edu/courses/355" target="_blank">organizations and management</a> in Duke's Markets and Management certificate program and mentored undergraduate and masters students in a 10-week <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/analytics-faculty-success" target="_blank">data analytics program</a>. I am currently a Project Manager at Duke's Social Science Research Institute for the <a href="https://ssri.duke.edu/projects/human-capital-career-dynamics-and-organizational-performance-us-federal-government" target="_blank">Human Capital and Career Dynamics project</a>.</p>  -->
