	<h4>Hi there!</h4>
	<p>Thanks for checking out my website. I’m a PhD candidate in sociology at <a href="http://sociology.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a> and a Graduate Scholar with Duke’s <a href="http://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/regulation/" target="_blank">Rethinking Regulation Program</a>. My dissertation research is part of the project on <a href="https://ssri.duke.edu/projects/human-capital-career-dynamics-and-organizational-performance-us-federal-government" target="_blank">Human Capital, Career Dynamics, and Organizational Performance in the U.S. Federal Government</a>, which I am the Project Manager for. I also have ongoing projects with colleagues looking at the influence of government support on patents, career patterns of successful academics, and computational methods for analyzing culture and politics in news media.</p>
	<p>Broadly, my research interests include:
		<li><a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.soc.30.012703.110644" target="_blank">organizational</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/13" target="_blank">economic</a> sociology</li>
		<li>innovation and knowledge diffusion</li>
		<li>organizational governance systems</li>
		<li>culture, morality, and political beliefs</li>
	</p>
	<p>Methodologically, I am interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sociology" target="_blank">computational sociology</a> and the application of data science methods to social phenomena, especially social network analysis and automated content analysis of text, as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2619v1.pdf" target="_blank">causal inference methods</a>.
