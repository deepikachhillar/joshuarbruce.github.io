<h4>Research Summary</h4>
<p>My research is focused primarily on employee capabilities and workplace dynamics. Skills, capabilities, and knowledge held by people working in and across organizations represent both individual and organizational resources. As such, my research looks at outcomes at both the individual level (e.g., promotion) and the organizational level (e.g., technology innovation). Across these two streams of research, I draw on both strategic management and organizational theory, applying concepts from these domains to large datasets of personnel records and innovative activity. I strive to incorporate analytical granularity that is often missed in analyses of these processes, such as social status and geographic distance.</p>

<p>In my dissertation, I look at how people get ahead, both financially and in terms of managerial oversight, in the US civil service. These are important outcomes for addressing intragenerational mobility and organizational resource control in large organizations. The mechanisms I focus on--employees’ skillsets and occupational social status--are core sociological concepts that benefit from a deeper integration with labor economics and other disciplinary approaches. Skillsets are shown to be important mechanisms of advancement by enabling intra-organizational coordination between coworkers, which employers reward with higher pay. Social status is an important feature of public-sector employment because many of the occupations with the highest social esteem do not exert the greatest control over government personnel (i.e., the highest managerial authority). Thus, there is a tradeoff between status and power in the civil service, with implications for which personnel end up on the highest rungs of the administrative ladder. These projects both inform theories of employment and empirical knowledge on internal labor markets and public-sector employment.</p>

<p>In addition to these individual-level projects, my second stream of research uses person-level data to measure and examine the effects of organizational capabilities, especially on innovative performance. My co-authors on these projects are both strategy researchers (John M. de Figueiredo and Brian S. Silverman), and our collaborations represent my continued interest in crosspollinating between sociological concepts and methods and strategic management applications. Our first joint paper is forthcoming in Strategic Management Journal, addressing R&D contract form selection when the government wants to fund private-sector innovation, which has downstream implications for innovative outcomes. In addition to this paper, we are currently working on two additional projects. The first will link oversight capabilities (i.e., personnel skills) to contract fulfillment, explicitly aiming to introduce a new public dataset for other researchers that ties longitudinal government capabilities to geographic identifiers. The second paper examines broader societal implications stemming from the presence of government personnel, especially scientists, in diverse geographic locations.</p>

<p>Longer-term projects will continue to build on these themes of individuals’ knowledge and performance outcomes. Two projects have already been proposed and relevant data collected. The first, building on the forthcoming SMJ paper, will examine inter-organizational knowledge transfer between public and private entities, which occurs during cooperative research agreements established between the government and firms. The second, a sole-authored project, will examine a similar process while using a notably different (proprietary) dataset and context: the patenting and academic publishing activity of R1 university professors across the United States. The objective of these projects is to tie collaboration to knowledge sharing outcomes, which have clear implications for scientific development in multiple sectors. A third solo project, currently in the data collection phase, bridges the collaborative, knowledge-sharing literatures and research on the social status of entrepreneurs and inventors, looking at the joint influence of both processes on technology adoption in an open source software community (i.e., R packages and R users).</p>
